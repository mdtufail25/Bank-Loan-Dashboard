# Bank-Loan-Dashboard
📢 Bank Loan Dashboard 
 using SQL & Power BI

I recently completed a hands-on data analytics project that involved SQL-based data analysis followed by dashboard development in Power BI.

🔍 Objective: Analyze historical bank loan data to understand key lending trends, performance metrics, and risk segmentation.

🔧 Tech Stack Used:

SQL: Data cleaning, aggregations, grouping, filtering, date-based calculations

Power BI: KPI cards, interactive visuals, slicers, drill-throughs, DAX measures


⚙️ What I Did (SQL Highlights):

Calculated total, MTD, PMTD metrics for loan applications, funded amounts, and payments

Derived Average Interest Rate and Average DTI using SQL AVG & ROUND

Segmented Good vs Bad Loans using CASE and conditional counts

Grouped data by month, loan term, state, employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership

Used DATE functions like MONTH(), YEAR(), and DATENAME() for time-based analysis

Built custom aggregations to compare performance by loan status


📊 Power BI Dashboard:
The final report includes:

KPI Overview Cards

Trend Charts (monthly loan volume)

Pie & Donut Charts for loan type distribution

Detailed views using slicers (term, grade, state, loan status)

Drill-down into loan-level details (amounts, purpose, interest rate)


💡 Key Learnings:

Writing efficient SQL queries to prepare analysis-ready data

Using Power BI to create interactive & dynamic visuals

Building a dashboard that is both informative and easy to navigate


🧠 This project helped me understand how SQL + Power BI together form the backbone of real-world data analysis workflows.

🎯 I'm now more confident in delivering insights that matter in the financial analytics space.
